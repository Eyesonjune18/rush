# Rush Plugin Development Kit

> Write plugins that extend the behavior of the Rush shell

## Installation

```sh
cargo add https://github.com/Eyesonjune18/rush.git rush-pdk
```

## Overview

Plugins are WebAssembly (`wasm`) modules that can provide unique functionality to the Rush shell. The Rush PDK allows you to react to events broadcasted by Rush and affect the shell from your plugins.


Rust ðŸ¦€ compiled to one of the `wasm32-wasi` or `wasm32-unknown-unknown` targets is the officially supported method for writing plugins.

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

## Usage

Rush PDK provides a `plugin_fn` attribute which enables the Rush shell to run your event listeners. The name of the function you apply it to determines when it will be run.

```rs
use rush_pdk::*;

#[plugin_fn]
pub fn rush_plugin_init(init_info: Json<InitHookParams>) -> FnResult<Json<()>> {
    // print a welcome message on startup
    let msg = format!("Welcome to Rush v{}!", init_info.0.rush_version);
    output_text(msg);

    Ok(Json(()))
}
```
